## About Me 👨‍💻
Venturing into a new realm in March 2023, I embarked on an exciting journey as a mobile app developer. Armed with a passion for learning, I delved into Flutter, mastering the intricacies of the framework. In this transformative phase, I spearheaded the creation of two impactful projects. Tripline, an innovative Trip Planner app, showcases my proficiency in Flutter and UI design, seamlessly integrating local databases for optimal performance. Simultaneously, I introduced Propertify, a comprehensive Real Estate Application, developing user and agent-centric mobile applications along with a web admin dashboard using Flutter. My expanded skill set includes expertise in advanced Flutter topics, Node JS, MongoDB, and the implementation of Socket.IO for chat functionality.
